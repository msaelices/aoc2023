    """
    In part 2, this code implements a Rabin-Karp style multi-pattern matcher.
    To simplify things, since patterns are up to 5 chars, we keep a unique
    code that represents the last four characters by simply packing them into
    an integer. The match is executed by looking up which patterns end in the
    _current_ letter and then checking if the code for the last 4 letters match.
    Shorter words are appropriately masked, so that we only check appropriate
    number of bytes always.
